# Git Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive Git tutorial! This README will guide you through essential and advanced Git commands, with helpful tips, examples, and best practices. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸŽ‰

---

## 1. Basic Git Configuration

Set your global username and email to identify your commits:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<username>"
git config --global user.email "<useremail>"
````

Set the default branch to `main` for new repositories:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Clear your terminal (equivalent to `cls` in Windows):

```bash
clear
```

---

## 2. Initialize and Track a Repository

Initialize a new Git repository in the current folder:

```bash
git init
```

Check the status of your repository (shows current branch, staged and unstaged changes):

```bash
git status
```

Add a file to the staging area:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

Add all modified and new files:

```bash
git add --all
# or
git add -A
# or
git add .
```

Remove a file from Git tracking (but keep it locally):

```bash
git rm --cached <filename>
```

Recursively remove a folder from tracking:

```bash
git rm --cached -r <foldername>
```

Completely remove a file from your repository:

```bash
git rm "<filename>"
```

Rename a file:

```bash
git mv "<original filename>" "<new filename>"
```

Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
```

Skip the staging area and commit all tracked changes:

```bash
git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
```

Amend the last commit (e.g., fix a typo in the commit message):

```bash
git commit --amend -m "<new commit message>"
```

Use relative dates to change commit timestamps (e.g., "3.days.ago"):

```bash
git commit --date="3.days.ago" -m "Cheeky backdated commit"
```

---

## 3. The `.gitignore` File

To ignore specific files or directories, create a `.gitignore` file in your repository:

```
# Example .gitignore
*.pyc
__pycache__/
logs/
*.log
.env
```

> **Pro Tip:** Use `.gitignore` to keep sensitive or unnecessary files out of your repository.

---

## 4. Inspecting and Comparing Changes

See modifications to tracked files:

```bash
git diff
```

Restore a file to its last committed state:

```bash
git restore <filename>
```

Unstage a file from the staging area:

```bash
git restore --staged <filename>
```

---

## 5. Viewing Commit History

Detailed commit logs:

```bash
git log
```

Short, one-line commit logs:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

View diffs for each commit:

```bash
git log -p
```

---

## 6. Resetting and Rebasing

Reset your repository to a specific commit (revert the working directory to that commit):

```bash
git reset <commit-id>
```

Rebase interactively from the root commit:

```bash
git rebase -i --root
# In Vim: make your changes, then press :x to save and exit.
```

---

## 7. Working with Branches

Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch <branchname>
```

View all branches:

```bash
git branch
```

Delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d <branchname>
```

Rename the current branch to `main`:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

Switch to another branch:

```bash
git switch <branchname>
```

Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```

Another option to switch to another branch:

```bash
git checkout <another-branch-name>
```

Delete a branch:

```bash
git push -d <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

Delete a branch using --force:

```bash
git push -D <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

---

## 8. Merging Branches

Merge another branch into your current branch:

```bash
git merge -m "<merge commit message>" <branchname>
```

> **Important:** Commit your changes before merging to avoid conflicts!

---

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

If a conflict occurs during a merge:

1. Open the conflicted file.
2. Choose between `HEAD` (your current branch) or the incoming branch (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
3. Delete the conflict markers and unnecessary content.
4. Save the file.
5. Commit the resolved changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
```

---

## 9. Pushing to a Remote Repository

After renaming your main branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 10. Additional Helpful Commands

* Display help for any Git command:

```bash
git help <command>
```

* Configure handy aliases in `.gitconfig`:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

* View differences between branches:

```bash
git diff <branch1>..<branch2>
```

* Temporarily store uncommitted changes:

```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```

* Clone a remote repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

* Check remote URLs:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## 11. Bonus Tips & Trivia

ðŸŒŸ Use Git hooks (in `.git/hooks/`) to automate tasks like running tests before a commit.
ðŸŒŸ Explore Git GUI tools like GitKraken, Sourcetree, or VS Codeâ€™s Git integration!
ðŸŒŸ Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel.
ðŸŒŸ Collaborate using platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for remote repositories and issue tracking.
